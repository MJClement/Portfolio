      ‘The Perry Line’ is an archive of genealogy and family history that documents the ways in which information and stories are preserved over time. The book also includes links to wider social and political events that help to anchor the content within a broader historic context.

      The typeface “Dulcie” was designed for the purpose of being used within the publication. Dulcie was inspired by the music score sheets of Nola Dulcie Perry, my great grandmother. I have fond memories of family Christmas’s when she would open the piano and begin to play. Sadly, Nola passed away in 2013, all her music and pieces she had collected over the years were passed down to her daughter. In the process of researching my own family history for this project I came across the score sheets in storage. I was fascinated by the typeface on one of her favorite songs HAERE MAI. Recreating and digitizing the typeface was my goal for this project. Studying the unique features of this serif font helped me better understand the process of making a typeface and the level of detail involved. The final typeface is named Dulcie in recognition to my great grandmother, the source of inspiration. The typeface is only in uppercase to be accurate to the original where necessary.

      The intention of this book was to document the array of research that was discovered during this process and to display how documents are preserved and have evolved over time. The final result is a 470 page book that has an exposed stitched binding with an embossed hard front and back cover.
